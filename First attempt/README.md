Attempt to a 3D console game engine base on this tutorial: https://youtu.be/ih20l3pJoeU.

For some reasons it is not working even if I have the **EXACT SAME CODE** of the tutorial. Maybe it's my Visual Studio version that causes this problem (I'm using the 2019 community version).

# No license so...
There's no license so you can download the code if you want but it's kind of useless cause of the problems.

# If you find what is the problem and how to fix it...
If you find how to fix the problem, you can contact me on Discord, my tag is Anox3D#9720.
